To get started, set your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables. You may also have to apply for access to the model that you want on Bedrock.

Next, change a few of the prompts in prompts.txt and edit promptfooconfig.yaml.

Then run:

```
npx promptfoo@latest eval
```

Afterwards, you can view the results by running `npx promptfoo@latest view`
